## Testing
Testing is important for big projects. So we have good old js combo!

App is configured for running end-to-end (via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/)) and unit (via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)) tests

`npm run e2e` shortcut for executing end-to-end tests. 
`npm run test` for unit tests.
